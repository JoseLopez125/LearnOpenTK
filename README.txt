I followed tutorials in the following link:
https://opentk.net/learn/index.html

I also used the following GitHub Repo as a reference:
https://github.com/opentk/LearnOpenTK/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file

Lessons:
Draw Triangle
    - In this project I simply learned how to draw a tringale to the screen
Draw Rectangle
    - This builds on Draw Triangle and uses Element buffer objects
